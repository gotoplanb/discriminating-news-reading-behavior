Table 4.4. Average fixation frequencies are greatest during initial exposure and decrease over time. Changes are significantly larger for the first three 30-second intervals and level off for the remainder of the exposure. 77

Table 4.5. Probability for what type of visual element will be fixated upon next given the participant is currently looking at a text or ASF element. Reported for print prototypes separately and merged together. 79

Table 4.6 Probability for what type of visual element will be fixated upon next given the participant is currently looking at a text or ASF element. Reported for online prototypes separately and merged together. 79

# Discriminating News-Reading Behavior and Cognition Using Eye-Tracking Methodologies

Major: mass communication

News design is mostly governed by tradition and subjective sense. The effectiveness of the traditions becomes increasingly suspect as print newspaper readership falls and digital platforms multiply. The multitude of news platforms beyond traditional newspaper, radio and television requires a new approach to studying news consumers. The current study utilizes eye-tracking methodologies to directly measure reading behavior and, by proxy, glean understanding in cognition of news story forms.

Direct behavioral measurement is crucial to understanding how individuals detect available visual information, parse the categories of information, prioritize information seeking, and cognitively process that information for memory. Self-report methods can be useful for insight into what news consumers believe they want to look at, but only behavioral methods such as eye tracking can reliably show what visual information individuals look at, for how long and in which patterns.

Understanding reading patterns and subsequent cognition is vital for news designers to make efficient and informed choices of how to select story forms, such as text, maps, charts and other imagery, to convey information as effectively as possible. Informed design choices can lower the cognitive load required to detect, parse and prioritize available visual information, which in turn allows more cognitive resources to be available for in-depth processing, learning and storage.
