# Discriminating News-Reading Behavior and Cognition Using Eye-Tracking Methodologies

Major: mass communication

News design is mostly governed by tradition and subjective sense. The effectiveness of the traditions becomes increasingly suspect as print newspaper readership falls and digital platforms multiply. The multitude of news platforms beyond traditional newspaper, radio and television requires a new approach to studying news consumers. The current study utilizes eye-tracking methodologies to directly measure reading behavior and, by proxy, glean understanding in cognition of news story forms.

Direct behavioral measurement is crucial to understanding how individuals detect available visual information, parse the categories of information, prioritize information seeking, and cognitively process that information for memory. Self-report methods can be useful for insight into what news consumers believe they want to look at, but only behavioral methods such as eye tracking can reliably show what visual information individuals look at, for how long and in which patterns.

Understanding reading patterns and subsequent cognition is vital for news designers to make efficient and informed choices of how to select story forms, such as text, maps, charts and other imagery, to convey information as effectively as possible. Informed design choices can lower the cognitive load required to detect, parse and prioritize available visual information, which in turn allows more cognitive resources to be available for in-depth processing, learning and storage.

News designers need guidelines to help them utilize story forms to optimally achieve goals. For example, eye-movement patterns can show which visual structures garner attention, which are ignored and which are looked at first. This study compares 200 participants reading news across three, prototype print newspapers and three, prototype news websites.

News prototypes utilizing story forms designed for specific types of information, such as a map to convey geographic information, yielded better learning as measured by a post-exposure, information-recognition questionnaire. There were some inherent behavioral differences between print and online news prototypes, but these effects were overshadowed by story-form choices. Regardless of print, web or other emerging news platforms, a better understanding of how people read and learn from the news will allow news designers to maximize results and minimize efforts.

# Introduction

The influx of digital devices into newspaper production and delivery routines is revolutionizing the industry. But this revolution also raises important questions: How do people read these new platforms and story structures? How will people behave given more choices and more control? How can information be delivered to maximize cognition? If research can better understand how people consume and process news information, news companies will be able to create and deliver content that optimally balances the costs of gathering that information with measurable benefits to the consumer. Benefits could include understanding a public-health issue that allows the individual to make more thoughtful civic decisions. Perhaps the objective is for a reader to be exposed to as much content as possible in order to generate advertising revenue. Or maybe the objective if for an information consumer to make a purchase. Some desired outcomes are altruistic and some aim to maximize profit. Whatever the motive, news companies need better guidelines for how to package and deliver information based on content type and desired outcomes. This spans traditional media, the web, mobile devices and other platforms that have yet to emerge.

Newspapers carry a tradition of being interested in the public good in addition to making money (Merritt, 2005). In order to accomplish these dual roles, news companies need a more systematic process to choose how to allocate time, talent and money in an environment of economic uncertainty. In an effort to give a framework to that process, 200 newspaper readers from Southwest Florida were selected to participate in an eye-tracking study and read newspaper prototypes while having their eye movements recorded from July to November of 2006. The findings of how these people read different visual presentations of the same content will provide the foundation for a quantitative decision framework for news design based on the type of information to be delivered and a measurable outcome of success. 

## The Newspaper Industry in Context

The newspaper industry is at a crossroad. It is facing perhaps unprecedented economic challenges. Circulation numbers for daily newspapers have been declining since all-time peaks in the early 1990s. Total paid circulation has dropped 21.6% since that time (NAA, 2009). Shares of *The New York Times* are essentially flat over the last 18 years, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has grown four fold before the large drop during the fall of 2008. Over this time period, the Internet came into the public domain and now provides a transmission system for content creators, automated news-filtering application and an infrastructure that gives consumers control of what types of information they want, when and to some extent in what form. Perhaps newspapers are not delivering information in ways that readers want, expect or prefer in this new digital information environment where the user controls what information he or she receives. Individuals are assuming much of the gatekeeping responsibility traditionally handled by newspaper editors (White, 1950; Singer, 2003; Singer, 2005).

Convergence is becoming a stale buzzword. Early in the 2000s, there was a movement to structurally converge newspapers, television and other information media into a single news operation. The movement had minimal success in Florida and even less in states with journalism labor unions (Quinn, 2002). Now information providers create content for many platforms. Instead of merging with a television station, newspapers are producing and distributing original video content through the Internet to websites and mobile devices on their own.

Newspapers are re-defining themselves as information delivery companies rather than printers of paper. But with this immense new toolbox of web, video, audio, mapping, databases, etc., the news industry is in desperate need of metrics to determine resource allocation. Instead of off-the-cuff decisions for using traditional story forms or alternative approaches, publications should be able to use metrics to determine when and how to use story forms and multimedia tools to efficiently achieve a desired outcome such as exposure, recall, recognition, a call to action, sales or other desired outcomes on a story-by-story basis. The current study utilizes print and web-based news prototypes containing many combinations of traditional narratives, information graphics, maps and other story structures that take time and skilled staff to create. Theories of cognition posit that the density of information and the choices available to the news consumer can affect information processing, storage and retrieval (Lang, 2000; Wise, Bolls & Schaefer, 2008). This study will apply and test this concept to different news story forms using eye-tracking methodologies. News companies need a quantitative decision framework to allow the most effective allocation of resources for hiring staff, developing continuing-education programs, purchasing equipment, and creating and distributing information to better serve news consumers and fulfill traditional journalistic missions.
