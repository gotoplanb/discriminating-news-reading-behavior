Major: mass communication

News design is mostly governed by tradition and subjective sense. The effectiveness of the traditions becomes increasingly suspect as print newspaper readership falls and digital platforms multiply. The multitude of news platforms beyond traditional newspaper, radio and television requires a new approach to studying news consumers. The current study utilizes eye-tracking methodologies to directly measure reading behavior and, by proxy, glean understanding in cognition of news story forms.

Direct behavioral measurement is crucial to understanding how individuals detect available visual information, parse the categories of information, prioritize information seeking, and cognitively process that information for memory. Self-report methods can be useful for insight into what news consumers believe they want to look at, but only behavioral methods such as eye tracking can reliably show what visual information individuals look at, for how long and in which patterns.

Understanding reading patterns and subsequent cognition is vital for news designers to make efficient and informed choices of how to select story forms, such as text, maps, charts and other imagery, to convey information as effectively as possible. Informed design choices can lower the cognitive load required to detect, parse and prioritize available visual information, which in turn allows more cognitive resources to be available for in-depth processing, learning and storage.

News designers need guidelines to help them utilize story forms to optimally achieve goals. For example, eye-movement patterns can show which visual structures garner attention, which are ignored and which are looked at first. This study compares 200 participants reading news across three, prototype print newspapers and three, prototype news websites.

News prototypes utilizing story forms designed for specific types of information, such as a map to convey geographic information, yielded better learning as measured by a post-exposure, information-recognition questionnaire. There were some inherent behavioral differences between print and online news prototypes, but these effects were overshadowed by story-form choices. Regardless of print, web or other emerging news platforms, a better understanding of how people read and learn from the news will allow news designers to maximize results and minimize efforts.

# Introduction

The influx of digital devices into newspaper production and delivery routines is revolutionizing the industry. But this revolution also raises important questions: How do people read these new platforms and story structures? How will people behave given more choices and more control? How can information be delivered to maximize cognition? If research can better understand how people consume and process news information, news companies will be able to create and deliver content that optimally balances the costs of gathering that information with measurable benefits to the consumer. Benefits could include understanding a public-health issue that allows the individual to make more thoughtful civic decisions. Perhaps the objective is for a reader to be exposed to as much content as possible in order to generate advertising revenue. Or maybe the objective if for an information consumer to make a purchase. Some desired outcomes are altruistic and some aim to maximize profit. Whatever the motive, news companies need better guidelines for how to package and deliver information based on content type and desired outcomes. This spans traditional media, the web, mobile devices and other platforms that have yet to emerge.

Newspapers carry a tradition of being interested in the public good in addition to making money (Merritt, 2005). In order to accomplish these dual roles, news companies need a more systematic process to choose how to allocate time, talent and money in an environment of economic uncertainty. In an effort to give a framework to that process, 200 newspaper readers from Southwest Florida were selected to participate in an eye-tracking study and read newspaper prototypes while having their eye movements recorded from July to November of 2006. The findings of how these people read different visual presentations of the same content will provide the foundation for a quantitative decision framework for news design based on the type of information to be delivered and a measurable outcome of success. 

## The Newspaper Industry in Context

The newspaper industry is at a crossroad. It is facing perhaps unprecedented economic challenges. Circulation numbers for daily newspapers have been declining since all-time peaks in the early 1990s. Total paid circulation has dropped 21.6% since that time (NAA, 2009). Shares of *The New York Times* are essentially flat over the last 18 years, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has grown four fold before the large drop during the fall of 2008. Over this time period, the Internet came into the public domain and now provides a transmission system for content creators, automated news-filtering application and an infrastructure that gives consumers control of what types of information they want, when and to some extent in what form. Perhaps newspapers are not delivering information in ways that readers want, expect or prefer in this new digital information environment where the user controls what information he or she receives. Individuals are assuming much of the gatekeeping responsibility traditionally handled by newspaper editors (White, 1950; Singer, 2003; Singer, 2005).

Convergence is becoming a stale buzzword. Early in the 2000s, there was a movement to structurally converge newspapers, television and other information media into a single news operation. The movement had minimal success in Florida and even less in states with journalism labor unions (Quinn, 2002). Now information providers create content for many platforms. Instead of merging with a television station, newspapers are producing and distributing original video content through the Internet to websites and mobile devices on their own.

Newspapers are re-defining themselves as information delivery companies rather than printers of paper. But with this immense new toolbox of web, video, audio, mapping, databases, etc., the news industry is in desperate need of metrics to determine resource allocation. Instead of off-the-cuff decisions for using traditional story forms or alternative approaches, publications should be able to use metrics to determine when and how to use story forms and multimedia tools to efficiently achieve a desired outcome such as exposure, recall, recognition, a call to action, sales or other desired outcomes on a story-by-story basis. The current study utilizes print and web-based news prototypes containing many combinations of traditional narratives, information graphics, maps and other story structures that take time and skilled staff to create. Theories of cognition posit that the density of information and the choices available to the news consumer can affect information processing, storage and retrieval (Lang, 2000; Wise, Bolls & Schaefer, 2008). This study will apply and test this concept to different news story forms using eye-tracking methodologies. News companies need a quantitative decision framework to allow the most effective allocation of resources for hiring staff, developing continuing-education programs, purchasing equipment, and creating and distributing information to better serve news consumers and fulfill traditional journalistic missions. 

## Improving Reading Measures

There have been remarkably few studies utilizing quantitative measures of real news reading behavior (Rhee & Capella, 1997), which can include eye tracking, monitoring heart rate and other physiological measures. Much of the research regarding the behavior and habits of newspaper readers is based on survey and other self-report data (Potter, 2008; Tewksbury, Hals & Bibart, 2008; Geiger & Reeves, 1999). While surveys can answer many questions such as those concerning attitude and affect, introspection is an unreliable measure of behavior and not predictive of future behavior. The ability to gauge a feeling or attitude at any particular moment is difficult. Experimental designs help determine what specific changes within a stimulus cause changes in participant reactions to those stimuli. Generalizing beyond the experiment is difficult because the underlying physiological processes of why people change or respond during an experiment are not directly measured. Validly forecasting how people will react to future scenarios can be improved by incorporating physiological measures in order to more validly measure underlying behavioral and cognitive processes. 

Eye-tracking technologies, originally developed to understand how people look at images (Yarbus, 1967), allow a more direct measure of behavior by using cameras to continually record the movement of eyes during visual exposure. These movements serve as indicators of visual detection and information processing, which in turn influences how messages are mentally stored and retrieved. Eye-tracking apparatuses are used in diverse fields such as neuroscience, linguistics, ergonomics and marketing. Up to now, most of the eye-tracking research done to examine how people read online has been conducted from business and marketing perspectives. These studies are often task-oriented, such as requiring the participant to find a piece of information or complete some activity in an effort to optimize the time to complete the task while keeping a low rate of failure during the task. Jakob Nielsen and the Nielsen/Norman Group probably are the most well-known eye-tracking and usability experts for industry applications (Nielsen, 2006) to measure information-seeking strategies while reading Web sites. However, their research objectives raise concerns of improperly generalizing findings to news reading. For example, participants may be told what product or piece of information they are looking for, or they may be given a short task list to complete. Some newspaper readers may have a personal set of tasks to accomplish while reading a newspaper. Others may prefer to "discover" the news. They do not always need to fill a specific gap in their knowledge (Tewksbury et al., 2008). However, research findings based on a task list should not be applied when the individual is in an information-discovery mode. Likewise, findings on how people browse through information should not be applied to understand a user when there is a specific task to accomplish. Both types of information-consumption behaviors are important but must be conceptually separated.

## Research Approach

The expected outcomes or motivations for reading a newspaper can be different than looking at product information, such as being able to make a better voting decision versus buying the appropriate cell phone. But it is understandable why previous findings have been incorrectly applied to scenarios beyond those used in the research -- the findings were all that was available. Eye-tracking studies to measure reading behaviors are expensive, time consuming and statistically intensive. Businesses selling consumer goods have resources to conduct this research because there is a tradition of supporting marketing research with measurable success goals such as increased sales. Success in newspapers had been measured by winning awards. With falling circulation and advertising revenue, newspaper companies are being forced to balance the traditional public service mission with awareness of which stories generate the revenue that was a given for so many years. Newspapers do not have a history of investing in large-scale quantitative research of he content and design of news. Now, lack of cash makes research undertakings even more difficult to begin although research is more important than ever. That is one of the gaps the Poynter Institute is attempting to bridge with its support of eye-tracking research through funding the data-gathering phase of this project and others. Created by newspaper owner Nelson Poynter in 1975, The Poynter Institute is funded by the profits of the *St. Petersburg Times* newspaper, the largest independent newspaper in the United States. The Institute exists partly to provide "practical leadership of successful business" for the media industry (Poynter, 2007a).

The Poynter Institute has the financial resources to undertake large research projects because of its mission to improve the journalism industry as a whole (Poynter, 2007a) instead of having to pay shareholders. The current study is based on raw data collected along with the EyeTrack07 project (Adam, Quinn & Edmonds, 2007), the fourth eye-tracking project conducted by The Poynter Institute. In that project, the Poynter team used head-mounted, eye-tracking gear to record eye movements as people read real-world publications including the *St. Petersburg Times* (print and online), the *Minneapolis Star-Tribune* (print and online), the *Rocky Mountain News* (print) and the *Philadelphia Daily News* (print). The EyeTrack07 study was one of the most expensive and expansive quantitative studies of news-reader behavior ever attempted (Adam, Quinn & Edmonds, 2007). Along with real news publications, Poynter also tracked the eye movements of readers exposed to news prototypes. The current study will use these news prototypes as the foundation for a quantitative framework to help content producers more efficiently and effectively package and transmit news to consumers through different media and storytelling structures.

Three print and three online prototypes were created by professional news designers to reflect possible versions of a typical newspaper (or Web site) story. The first print and online prototypes were designed to represent a traditional approach utilizing a text-based narrative with an inverted-pyramid-style lead story. The second versions utilized some alternative story forms such as a map and a fact box in addition to a text story. The third versions contained no traditional narrative elements. These prototype variations helped test how visual story structures relate to information processing, storage and retrieval.

Another unique aspect of this research was the inclusion of sequential and temporal information with content analysis methodologies. Properly describing an individual's exposure to visual information over time requires the preservation of event sequences and the incorporation of dependent observations. Typical content analysis does not account for this information. However, using statistical models, such as Markov chains, allows previous observations to provide useful information to predict future observations within an individual. Behavioral and cognition research has to accommodate previous information when modeling individual responses to media stimuli. One goal of this study is to introduce probabilistic dependence for content analysis methodologies, which traditionally have taken the approach of observation independence. Continually developing analytic tools will help researchers develop new theories and apply existing theories to a media environment where the lines between traditional print, television and radio media are disappearing. Simple measures of exposure to media lose validity when individuals attend to multiple devices and sources of information at the same time. Micro-exposure measures, including the use of physiological measures like eye tracking, quantify which pieces of information within a larger message are actually consumed and processed. Assuming dependence of micro-exposures in a news reading context means an individual is exposed to a small piece of the visual field containing information selected based on underlying cognitive processes. After exposure to one, small piece of visual information, the reader then selects another small piece of the visual field to read. The selection of what to read next is not made in a vacuum. The nature of the visual element currently being read provides information to improve predictions about where the individual will look next.

This study begins to answer how people look at different types of news story structures and describes the behavioral patterns used to consume news information. It addresses questions including: Can news designers use specific visual structures to efficiently communicate information that can be processed, stored and retrieved by readers? What are the mechanisms for how readers come to know what information is contained in news media, and then how do they consume this information? Do readers behave the same regardless of the media, or does the design and content of the media influence the ways readers interact with the media? Can what we learn using physiological measures like eye tracking be utilized with other types of measures to develop more realistic models of news reading?

The hypotheses test how individuals selectively read visual information and the implications of these behavioral patterns for cognition. Scanpath Theory (Noton & Stark, 1971), Feature Integration Theory (Treisman & Gelade, 1980) and Schema Theory (Wicks & Drew, 1991) predict underlying cognitive processes that allow individuals to make quick judgments as to the information available in the visual field. These heuristic judgments are based on the attributes of discrete visual structures. Readers spend time scanning and detecting all available information before selecting specific pieces of visual information. So, time during initial exposure will consist of scanning and detecting what type of information is available. After selecting and processing a portion of the visual field, individuals will select another portion of the visual field probabilistically determined in part by their current location of gaze. As the length of exposure increases, more time will be allocated toward reading and processing the visual field instead of detecting what information is available. This increase in processing and decrease in detection time is a manifestation of individuals creating mental maps that describe and associate information within the visual field. Using design to provide heuristic clues as to information contained within a visual structure, such as geographic information contained within a map, the amount of time and cognitive resources allocated toward detection and selection is decreased, and instead more cognitive resources are allocated to processing and storing information in memory.

The limited number of combinations used in one study will not provide results that will apply to all news reading. Instead, the primary objective of this study is to provide valid justification for using specific types of visual structures to communicate specific information most effectively. The results provide foundational models for how specific story forms often used in news design are selected, parsed, processed and stored in memory. Future research must build upon this macro design framework to understand how specific combinations of story-form type, size and orientation can allow reliable predictions as to configurations of these attributes that maximize information retention and minimize the costs of production. As an example, news designers should have a quantifiable justification for the size, shape and orientation of a photograph and caption text. All design choices come with tradeoffs. A photograph might demand running at a specific size based on the information and importance. However, this increase in photograph size means other information structures must be resized, deleted or moved within the visual field. This tradeoff should be made intelligently based on an overall increase in information retention, positive attitude toward the information, or some other metric of success for the information conveyed within the visual field.

Hopefully other researchers will be able to use the analytic tools and conceptual framework developed in this study as a starting point to quantify news design. Whether they work for newspapers, television stations or as independent bloggers, all information producers can benefit from a more systematic and quantifiable approach to making design choices. News design should prioritize consumer uses and needs for information. There will and should be room for design creativity, but the primary objective of news is to convey information to readers or viewers. This primary objective should be the focus of news design.
